  * `EmailSubmission/set`
  * `Identity/get`
  * `Mailbox/get`
  * `Mailbox/query`
  * `Thread/get`
  * Arbitrary methods via the `CustomMethod` class
* Combined requests with support for result references
* Basic JMAP method response error handling
* Unit tests for basic functionality and methods

Todo list:

* Write documentation

## Installation

[jmapc is available on PyPI][jmapc-pypi]:

```
pip install jmapc
```

## Development

Prerequisites: [Poetry][poetry]

* Repository setup: `poetry install`
* Run all tests: `poetry run poe test`
* Fix linting errors: `poetry run poe lint`

### Examples

Any of the included examples can be invoked with `poetry run`:

```sh
JMAP_HOST=jmap.example.com \
JMAP_USER=ness \
JMAP_PASSWORD=pk_fire \
poetry run examples/identity_get.py
```

If successful, `examples/identity_get.py` should output something like:

```
Identity 12345 is for Ness at ness@onett.example.com
Identity 67890 is for Ness at ness-alternate@onett.example.com
```
